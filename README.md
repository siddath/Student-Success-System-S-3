# Student-Support-System
Student Support System is my project that was developed during my final year of B.Tech as my major project. It acts as a medium (portal) between the students and the college and is an one stop solution for all student needs and queries. Made with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrao, Javscript. Cloud Computing and UI/UX were heavily focused upon and are implemented in this project. The project is linked to the Google Cloud Platform and makes use of Firebase, Firestore and DialogFlow to make sure that the platform is secure, scalable and fast when it comes to data. DialogFlow powers the AI chatbot which has been trained to answer generic queries and help the user.


An interactive Student Information system in cloud is a one stop portal where the students can get answers to all their queries. The users can check and update their personal details, communicate with faculties and avail a livechat to get their queries solved. Cloud technologies reduce the challenges faced by traditional systems such as costs associated with development  and maintenance. The student support system is ubiquitous in nature since it is hosted in cloud. Real time support is extended to the students using a chatbot powered by DialogFlow and the portal can handle traffic using load balancers. The information system can also be suited to potential students who visit the university website. This project focuses on making it user centric using various UX principles in order to make the portal easy to use. 
One of the most important things that makes the experience of visiting a website smooth and seamless is proper UI/UX with fast, lightweight, quick-loading features. This is why most modern well made websites make use of modern technologies and front-end frameworks such as ReactJs, Angular and Flutter. They focus more on single page applications which helps in making the feel of the website more natural and much less annoying to the end user. 
Current student information systems present in most academic institutions around the world still face a lot of downtime and server problems when the traffic on that page increases. The existing system updates the latest information on the system but they don’t update the technical requirements and design requirements to meet the demands. There is no instant feedback or help for the user. The existing users are required to register under multiple platforms to get information since the information is scattered and hence makes the user security fragile and that sums up to a bad experience overall.
A lot of resources are spent on recruiting and training people for roles where they have to interact with people and answer the same set of questions or do a specific set of instructions which can be automated. It is inefficient to spend human potential on answering questions that could be automated. This way it is automated and made much more efficient.
A student information portal hence could potentially solve all these problems by providing a one stop place for the student or the general public to get their general/common questions answered in an efficient and professional manner. This also helps the students of an  academic institution get personalized information according to their interests and needs. A cloud based system helps in scaling the website as well providing a stable, clean, efficient and fast environment for the student to get their information.

Student Support System is a smart cloud based student information system which is implemented through a modern smart, engaging and user friendly UI/UX and makes use of the power of modern cloud-computing technologies to provide the user a fast, efficient and elegant experience. The project will focus on smart and lightweight UI/UX along with fast, mobile functionalities that are implemented using Cloud Computing.
The main objective of this project is to build a robust, scalable, lightweight student information portal that can be deployed for academic institutions to improve their engagement with students as well as ease the load on the student and make everything accessible under one roof for the student. Using this system, the student can contact peers, alumni, professors and book appointments with them as well subscribe to different news and notifications which is implemented using a pub-sub model. They can also make use of the AI powered chatbot to get their basic queries answered.The system is planned to be implemented on cloud and focuses on various UI/UX to improve its usability. There is a livechat which is provided for the users to ask queries and get their doubts cleared at a preliminary level.  “Dialogflow” a software provided by Google Cloud platform will be used. UX principles such as market research and information architecture are going to be place to ensure the user is able to locate the information he/she is looking for. Font pairing, webpage layout and use of colors will be modified to further improve the usage of the website. This system when it is hosted with appropriate load balancers are expected to function without an issue as cloud presents an opportunity to scale both horizontally and vertically. The livechat feature and designing the portal in a user-oriented manner will be key in making the system more useable. 

The project consists of 4 modules. They are:
1.	LiveChat
2.	Dashboard
3.	Notification
4.	Contact information
The system is designed keeping in mind all the different kinds of features that could be made available so that the student has a seamless experience with a lot of features available to ease certain tasks/processes. 

To run the project:
1. Open folder in VSCODE.
2. Open App.html
3. Open with LiveServer

That's all. Hope you like it!
